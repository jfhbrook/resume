\affiliation{The Determination of Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity with Thermal
  Needle Probe Measurements}{May 2010 -- May 2011} A master's thesis on the
theory and viability of measuring anisotropic thermal conductivity in snow with
needle probes, including 3D finite element models in COMSOL and MATLAB; an
analytical model; a prototype experimental procedure for benchmarking the
technique; and the first attempt at using the technique against real snow
