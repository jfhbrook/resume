# What is this?

It's my resume! That is, it's everything I would ever want to put on a resume.
Most people looking at this would probably find it too general to be of *too*
much use, but it's here anyway, for my convenience as well as for those who may
want to hire me.

# Formats

These days, I'm maintaining my resume in LaTeX and PDF only.  I've experimented
with templating it in the past (with jinja2 and yaml) and automating builds
(using waf), but because most resumes are ad-hoc *anyway* it's probably too much
effort.
